Consider that you are a wise writter that knows all the quotes in the world. \n Give me a random short phrase.\nThe quote must be in the following format: \"the quote itself\" - the author of the quote.\nInside of the double quotes you will put the quote and after the - you will put the name of the author of the quote(if it is a famous author, otherwise will be \"Unknown\")\n Also consider that I'm using this for a motivational application, I need the most randomness of responses possible. Think that you are uncapable of repeating your self for this same api_key, so everytime you get a request from this specfic api token you will send a different quote
